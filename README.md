## Foundations Challenge 1

## Setup

1. You should have **Forked** the repository to your account from the Assessments page for Challenge 1 on learndot.
2. Go to your own newly created Challenge 1 repository on GitHub and **clone the Challenge1**
```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/challenge1.git
$ cd challenge1
```


## Complete the specs

3. Write your code in challenge1.js so that you can pass the specs in challenge1Spec.js
4. Run the test specs to test your code. To run the specs for a directory, you need to go into that directory and run the command `testem`.

```
$ cd challenge1
$ testem
TEST'EM 'SCRIPTS!
Open the URL below in a browser to connect.
http://localhost:7357/
```

## Submission

When you are passing all the specs, or have run out of time, commit your changes and push them up to your repository for the coding portion of the challenge to be graded in Learndot.

Make sure you press **Done** on the Challenge 1 Assessments Page to submit your Challenge when you are finished!

```
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m 'completed exercises'
$ git push origin master
```

Good luck!
