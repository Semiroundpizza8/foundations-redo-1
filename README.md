## Foundations Challenge 1

## Setup

1. **Fork** the repository to your account from the Assessments page for Challenge 1 on learndot.
2. Go to your own newly created Challenge 1 repository on GitHub and **clone the Challenge1**
```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/challenge1.git
$ cd challenge1
```


## Complete the specs

3. Write your code in challenge1.js
4. Run the test specs to test your code. To run the specs for a directory, you need to go into that directory and run the command `testem`.

```
$ cd challenge1
$ testem
TEST'EM 'SCRIPTS!
Open the URL below in a browser to connect.
http://localhost:7357/
```

## Submission

When you are passing all the specs, or have run out of time, commit your changes and push them up to your repository.

```
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m 'completed exercises'
$ git push origin master
```

Good luck!
