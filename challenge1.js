/* ** constuctor function Rectangle **

Create a constructor function named "Person" that returns an object with first and last name
properties.  The object returned should have access to a "findArea" function attached
to the constructor function's `.prototype` object which will return the area (width * height).

Names of properties on the instance (the object the "Person" constructor function creates).
.color
.height
.width


Note: The constructor function created will be invoked with the "new" keyword in the test specs,
 you do not have to invoke it with the new keyword.

 */

function Rectangle(color, height, width) {

}






/*  ** findObjProperties **

  The function `findObjectProperties` will take an object as an argument.
  Loop over the object and return the names of the keys that are on the object instance,
  not on its internal prototype (aka .__proto__).  Return all the keys on the object as
  a string. If there is more than one key, each key should be separated by a "," and a space.

*/

function findObjProperties(obj) {

}






/* ** rightTriangle **

Create the function "rightTriangle", it returns a string representing a right triangle using "*".
The number argument represents the number of rows the triangle will have.

 To create a "new line" concatenate "\n" to a string.

 So, sample input and output for this function could be:
 rightTriangle(5) returns "*****\n****\n***\n**\n*"

 Example:
 console.log(rightTriangle(5));

"*****
 ****
 ***
 **
 *"
